# 🌾 WayMark – Guiding Every Step with Trust

**WayMark** is an innovative application designed to transform the agricultural supply chain by directly connecting **farmers** and **dealers** through a transparent, blockchain-powered ecosystem. The platform eliminates intermediaries, ensures fair pricing, and brings trust, efficiency, and traceability to every stage of the supply process.

---

## 🚜 Problem Statement

The traditional agricultural supply chain is fragmented, opaque, and filled with intermediaries. Farmers often struggle to get fair prices for their produce due to lack of direct market access and limited pricing information. On the other hand, dealers and consumers face challenges in verifying product quality, origin, and authenticity. This lack of transparency leads to inefficiency, mistrust, and reduced profitability across the value chain.

## 💡 Solution – WayMark

WayMark creates a unified digital ecosystem that bridges the gap between farmers and dealers using **Blockchain** and **Generative AI**. It offers two distinct user experiences — one for farmers and one for dealers — all built around a foundation of trust and data transparency.

By tokenizing each crop batch as a unique digital asset on the **Polygon blockchain**, WayMark ensures traceability, authenticity, and ownership verification. As batches move through the supply chain, key events are recorded on-chain, providing a clear and immutable history of the product’s journey.
